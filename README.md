# Diabetes Mellitus Prediction using IBM Auto AI service

## Project Description:

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia. It may cause many complications. According to the growing morbidity in recent years, in 2040, the worldâ€™s diabetic patients will reach 642 million, which means that one of the ten adults in the future is suffering from diabetes.
In this project, we will be building a machine learning model that can efficiently discover the rules to predict diabetes mellitus of patients based on the given parameter about their health. The model needs to be deployed in the IBM cloud to get a scoring endpoint which can be used as API in web app building. The model prediction needs to be showcased on the User Interface.
